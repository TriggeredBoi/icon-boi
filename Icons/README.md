- Timestamps are in ``DD.MM`` format.
- You can use a dash to specify a time range like ``DD.MM-DD.MM``
- Examples of valid file names: ``6.9.png``, ``1.12-31.12.jpg``
- Gifs are supported, but they won't work unless your server has boosts. Capitalism.
- Discord has a cap to the file size of a server's icon, last time I checked it was 256kb. Make sure your file is under that limit.
- Also, keep any image named ``Default`` in this folder or it will scream.
